Beginner Questions
What is React?

Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.
What is JSX?

Answer: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. JSX allows you to write HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code.
What are components in React?

Answer: Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of code that represent parts of the user interface. Components can be either class-based or function-based.
What is the difference between state and props in React?

Answer: State is a local data storage that is local to the component and can be modified by the component itself. Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes used to pass data from one component to another.
What is a functional component?

Answer: A functional component is a simple JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. It is a stateless component, meaning it does not manage state directly.
Intermediate Questions
What is a class component?

Answer: A class component is a React component defined using an ES6 class. It can manage state and lifecycle methods, making it suitable for more complex scenarios than functional components.
What are lifecycle methods in React?

Answer: Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that get called at different stages of a component's life in a React application. Examples include componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
What is the Virtual DOM?

Answer: The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React updates the Virtual DOM first, then efficiently updates the real DOM to match the Virtual DOM.
What is the use of keys in React?

Answer: Keys are used to identify elements uniquely in lists. They help React to identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, allowing for efficient updates and re-rendering.
What is React Router?

Answer: React Router is a library used for handling navigation in React applications. It allows developers to define routes in the application and navigate between different views or pages.
Advanced Questions
What are hooks in React?

Answer: Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include useState, useEffect, and useContext.
What is the useEffect hook?

Answer: The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It can be used for tasks like fetching data, subscribing to events, or manually changing the DOM.
How does Context API work in React?

Answer: The Context API is used for sharing data across multiple components without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree. It consists of React.createContext, Provider, and Consumer.
What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?

Answer: Higher-Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component. HOCs are used for reusing component logic and adding functionality to existing components.
What is Redux, and how does it integrate with React?

Answer: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It works with React by providing a centralized store for the entire application's state and a predictable way to manage state changes through actions and reducers.
Expert Questions
Explain the reconciliation process in React.

Answer: Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM when a component's state or props change. React compares the new element tree with the previous one and only updates the parts of the DOM that have changed.
What is code splitting, and how can you implement it in a React app?

Answer: Code splitting is a technique to split your code into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand. In React, you can implement code splitting using dynamic imports with React.lazy and Suspense.
What is the purpose of the useMemo and useCallback hooks?

Answer: useMemo and useCallback are optimization hooks in React. useMemo memoizes the result of a computation to avoid recalculating it on every render, while useCallback memoizes a function to prevent it from being recreated on every render.
How would you handle performance optimization in a large React application?

Answer: Performance optimization in a React application can be handled through various techniques such as code splitting, lazy loading, memoizing components with React.memo, using useMemo and useCallback, optimizing re-renders, and using the Profiler API to identify performance bottlenecks.
Explain the concept of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React.

Answer: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a React application on the server rather than in the browser. This can improve performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered HTML to the client. Popular libraries for SSR in React include Next.js.
These questions should give you a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of React, from basic concepts to advanced topics.
