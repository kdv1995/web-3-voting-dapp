const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('An event occurred!');
});

myEmitter.emit('event');
Advanced Questions
What is middleware in Express.js?

Answer: Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request and response objects. They can execute code, make changes to the request/response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function. For example:
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
How do you connect a Node.js application to a MongoDB database?

Answer:
javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

const db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', () => {
  console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
});
What are child processes in Node.js?

Answer: Child processes allow you to execute other programs or scripts from a Node.js application. Node.js provides the child_process module to create and control child processes. For example:
javascript
Copy code
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('ls', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
  console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
});
How do you handle errors in Node.js?

Answer: Error handling in Node.js can be done using try-catch blocks for synchronous code and using callbacks, Promises, or async/await for asynchronous code. For example:
javascript
Copy code
// Synchronous
try {
  // code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}

// Asynchronous with Promises
someAsyncFunction().then(result => {
  // handle result
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
});

// Asynchronous with async/await
async function asyncFunction() {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncFunction();
    // handle result
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

asyncFunction();
What is the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?

Answer: process.nextTick() schedules a callback to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, before any I/O operations. setImmediate() schedules a callback to be invoked after the current I/O cycle. Example:
javascript
Copy code
process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('nextTick');
});

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('setImmediate');
});

console.log('Immediate execution');
// Output order: Immediate execution, nextTick, setImmediate

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

const app = express();

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded successfully');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
What is cluster module in Node.js and why is it used?

Answer: The cluster module in Node.js allows you to create child processes (workers) that share the same server port, taking advantage of multi-core systems. This helps improve the performance and reliability of the application. For example:
javascript
Copy code
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('Hello, World!\n');
  }).listen(8000);
}
How do you secure a Node.js application?

Answer: Securing a Node.js application involves multiple practices, such as:
Using HTTPS for encrypted communication.
Validating and sanitizing user input to prevent injection attacks.

javascript
Copy code
// CommonJS
const module = require('./module');
module.exports = myFunction;

// ES6 Modules
import myFunction from './module';
export default myFunction;
How do you handle real-time data with Node.js?
